Graduated from the School of Materials Science and Engineering of Zhengzhou University in June 2020, and will join the University of Science and Technology of China in September 2020. I am very interested in the research of energy materials and pay attention to hands-on ability and research experiments. I like running, keeping fit, reading and playing soccer.
